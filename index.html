      <h1>ABOUT ME!!</h1>
      <p>My name is Marady, pronounced Mar-ugh-dee and I go by she/her pronouns. 
         I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington 
         I have one amazing son and a loving husband! 
         My job experience mostly is in social work and service. I was
         a housing case manager for 4 years
         My goal for the next year is shift in careers and dip my feet in tech. In my 
         next career venture I hope to be working in Software Development as a front or back end developer. 
         </p>
